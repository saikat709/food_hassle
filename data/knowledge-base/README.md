## Future Enhancement

In future iterations, these PDFs can be processed and embedded into a vector database for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide more accurate, document-based responses.

For now, the chatbot uses its general knowledge and can be enhanced with specific information from these documents through manual prompt engineering or future RAG implementation.
